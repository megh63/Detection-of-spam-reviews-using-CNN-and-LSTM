# Detection-of-spam-reviews-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-algorithms
In today's environment, a powerful and reliable method for detecting spam reviews is critical in order to
acquire things without getting duped by internet companies. In many cases there, are choices for
publishing reviews on web sites, and thus allowing for the creation of fraudulent paid or untruthful
reviews. These fabricated evaluations have the potential to deceive the general public and put them in a
confusion about whether or not to believe the review. Well-known machine learning approaches have
been devised to mitigate the consequences of spam review diagnosis. Most recent research focuses on
supervised learning. When it comes to online updates, In this project, To achieve this, Deep learning
strategies such as CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and
other traditional machine learning algorithms such as Vector Support Machine (SVM) and -Multinomial
Naive are developed. Lastly, we have done the comparison of the accuracy for both machine learning
and deep learning methods discussed.
